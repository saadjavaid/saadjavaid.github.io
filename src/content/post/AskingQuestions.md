I recently wrote about my journey through the PhD path in which I mentioned leaning on some lighthearted guidance to get through the haze. I am now at the point in my PhD journey which is perhaps the most nerve-wracking for all aspirants; where I think I know enough to be hopeful but still not enough to be nervy about the big question : **_Do I have a path to being done?_** 

I always understood that the proposal is **the most critical** milestone of this journey because it defines whether you understand what you are doing and determines whether you'll essentially graduate or not. I always thought of it as a "contract" and I found it assuring when someone I respect a lot [echoed the same through his guidance](http://matt.might.net/articles/advice-for-phd-thesis-proposals/). I have put in a lot of effort into this and I keep on struggling with the most important aspect - **what is my thesis statement?** I have some decent results, a good framework and a wide array of experiments that I can quickly run to gather insights but I do not know what I want to achieve per se - I am still in that "exploratory" mindset. My advisor keeps saying that do not take your proposal as a contract, take it as an exam and just get through it - which I feel is very valuable and sincere advice, but for some reason I do not like the haze, the uncertainty with promising a direction and then hitting a dead end and being stuck. I think that's the fabled zone of confusion, or "outside your comfort zone" that I just have to get past without completely winging it. 

This little graphic by Grant Snider calmed a lot of my nerves and I feel it's a good thing to share with a lot of people who are discovering the element of confusion that I am at this stage. It's okay to ask questions - it's okay to be overwhelmed by them and its okay if the answers are big or small or none at all ! They all help you grow.
