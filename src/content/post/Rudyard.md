description: Rudyard Kipiling and materials ! Two of my inspirations

I am an avid Rudyard Kiping fan and his poem "If" is one of my go to pieces of literature for inspiration. I have spent a considerable amount of time learning, pursuing and even teaching materials so its only befitting that today I found something that combines both. Kipling's not-so-subtle take on which material is superior - enjoy.

>Gold is for the mistress - silver for the maid - \
Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade.' \
"Good !' said the Baron, sitting in his hall,  \
'But Iron - Cold Iron - is master of them all.
